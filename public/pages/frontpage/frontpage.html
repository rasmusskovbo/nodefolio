    This is a project made for the full-stack NodeJS course at KEA - Fall 2021</p>
<p>The objective is to create a site using NodeJS relevant modules.
<p>On this site you'll find my personal resume, available in preview form or for download as well as a contact form.</p>
<p>
    Furthermore there's an overview of handpicked projects, 
    served via an SQLite database. Data is created and update via a dashboard implemented on a seperate admin login page.

    Finally, there is a selection of links to relevant pages such as my GitHub and LinkedIn.
